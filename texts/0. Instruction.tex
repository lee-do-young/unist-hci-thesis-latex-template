Original latex file was from https://library.unist.ac.kr/research/thesis

Changes:
1. Added List of Tables section

2. Changed reference format as SIGCHI format

3. Made it easy to use (All you have to deal with is just files in texts folder, and the references.bib)


Instruction:
1. Put data in TODOs
 1.1. You need two pdfs for ~approvals.tex
 1.2. You need set variables for ~names.tex
 1.3. You can manage sections in ~sections.tex
 
2. Put contents in other files (Abstract to Conclusion)

3. Possibly you can change the file names (in the case, change ~sections.tex)

4. Possibly you can change the section order (do this in ~sections.tex)

5. 5. main.tex contains settings, so do not touch it without a specific reason
